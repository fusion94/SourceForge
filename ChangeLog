1.5.0 
	- Added a "portability" patch. Massive thanks to 
	  William Hardeman and David HM Spector for this. SF deployers 
	  everywhere will thank them

	- Removed a lot of hard-coded references to SF.net everywhere, 
	  including hard-coded user_id's of the SF core staff

	- Wallace Lee continues to make numerous clean patches throughout 
	  the site (naming forums/subprojects/mailing lists among others)

	- Optimizations throughout the code base - added intelligence to the
	  user.php and group.php library so database queries aren't wasted. 

	- Tested under PHP4 and only one know issue was found and fixed.

	- Starting the process of database portability. Changed the keyword 
	  "public" in groups to "is_public". Changing the "user" table to 
	  "users" is next in line, but it is a HUGE task.

	- Tested some features on Postgres and found that LIMIT/OFFSET 
	  syntax is incompatible. Postgres also cannot yet handle large 
	  text fields that are > 8K in length (problem for the patch Mgr)

	- Slick new "browse" options on the bug/task/support/project mgrs

	- Changed project homepages to "/projects/*project_name*/" using 
	  the .htaccess "files" directive. This is known to be problematic 
	  on some other platforms.

	- Laid groundwork for "portals" which are half-baked and considered 
	  useless right now.

	- Project Admin page modernized
