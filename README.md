### Breaking Down the Barriers to Open Source Development

This is a clone of the original source code that powered [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net) for a very long time. 
Even thought the source code is no longer relevant I wanted to place here on GitHub for historical purposes.

The original four co-founders of SourceForge were:

* [Tony Guntharp](http://fusion94.org)	
* [Drew Streib](http://dtype.org/)		
* [Tim Perdue](http://www.perdue.net/index2.php)			
* [Uriah Welcome](http://uriah.org/)		

All of this code was originally released under a GPL license. Since these releases came out SourceForge has moved to an
Apache License and has released the source code under the [Allura](https://sourceforge.net/projects/allura/) name.

I've tagged it appropriately with the release tags we originally used:

* [1.0.3](https://github.com/fusion94/SourceForge/tree/1.0.3)
* [1.0.4](https://github.com/fusion94/SourceForge/tree/1.0.4)
* [1.1.0](https://github.com/fusion94/SourceForge/tree/1.1.0)
* [1.5](https://github.com/fusion94/SourceForge/tree/1.5)
* [2.0](https://github.com/fusion94/SourceForge/tree/2.0)
* [2.5](https://github.com/fusion94/SourceForge/tree/2.5)

If you actually try to get this up and running all I can say is good luck.

Below is the latest README from the last GPL public release.
