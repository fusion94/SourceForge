<h2>Step 2: Terms of Service Agreement</h2>
</p>

<p>
<B>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</B> 
</p>

<p>
Welcome to SourceForge. SourceForge provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to 
time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: http://SourceForge.com/info/terms/. In addition, when using 
particular SourceForge services, you and your project shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from 
time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. 
</p>

<p>
<B>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</B> 
</p>

<p>
SourceForge currently provides users with access to a rich collection of on-line resources, including, various communications tools, online forums, 
shopping services, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties (the "Service"). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, 
any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new SourceForge properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You 
understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that SourceForge assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or 
failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.
</p>

<p>  
In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any 
service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a 
computer and modem or other access device. 
</p>

<p>
<B>3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</B> 
</p>

<p>
In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the 
Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, 
accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or SourceForge has reasonable grounds 
to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, SourceForge has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse 
any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). 
</p>

<p>
<B>4. SourceForge PRIVACY POLICY</B> 
</p>

<p>
Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. For more information, please see our full privacy policy at
http://SourceForge.com/info/privacy/. 
</p>

<p>
<B>5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</B>

SourceForge of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each 
session. SourceForge cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.

that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will SourceForge be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, for any
