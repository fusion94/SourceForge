<P><B>The 6 hour cron delay</B>

<P>Many functions on the SourceForge web site affect accounts
on other SourceForge machines. This includes all functions relating
to mail aliases, shell passwords, user additions, group member
changes, cvs repository creation, etc.

<P>Updates to these other systems happen via cron 4 times per
day, so changes made on the web site will appear to be live, but
will not take effect until the next cron update.

<P>The 'cron job' is actually several crons across several machines,
which takes several minutes to process, so the cron job counter
on the main documentation page is approximate.
