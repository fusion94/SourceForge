<P><B>SourceForge Services - Web Server</B>

<P>Each project receives its own Apache-style htdocs and cgi-bin directories.
CGI can be executed only from the cgi-bin directory and is ScriptAliased to
http://yourproject.SourceForge.net/cgi-bin/. Your domain is hosted on
a name-based VirtualHost on the main project web server.

<P>The Apache server is compiled with PHP3/MySQL support and is able to
access your MySQL database.

<P>There is a 100MB soft quota for your web site and anonymous FTP directory.
(The high-capacity file server has no limit.) More space can be requested.
