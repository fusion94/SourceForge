There really is no SourceForge install procedure, since our
site is spread across 21 servers.

Visit http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=1 and discuss 
issues in the "Offsite Talk" forum.

You can play with pieces of the site by setting up Apache/PHP
and pointing the document root to this distribution. It will
be necessary as well to setup MySQL and setup tables as described
in db/sourceforge.sql.

After that... :)

I'm not sure we'll ever really have something as simple as
an autoconf install, but we may be able to get certain modules
to work better as independent systems.
