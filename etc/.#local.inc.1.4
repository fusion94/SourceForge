//
// Really Important Safety Tip: --> DO NOT LEAVE ANY WHITE
// SPACE AFTER THE CLOSING PHP TAG AT THE END OF THIS FILE!
//
// Doing so will really confuse the software and cause
// 1) cookies to fail and 2) HTML page headers to fail
// which will give you some preally hard-to-debug problems.
// Why? PHP is a *pre-processor* -- anything that's not PHP gets
// emitted as part of the HTML stream and processed by the browser,
// so white space is meaningful!
//
//
// PART I - SourceForge hostnames
//
// Hostnames should be fully qualified domain names (FQDNs); using short names
// would be prettier but would stop you from distributing your SourceForge
// implementation across multiple domains.
//
// Of course, if you have a lot of machines serving a particular purpose
// such as FTP or for shell accounts, the "hostname" here might be in
// reality an addr_list of machines that is serviced by a round-robin
// mechanism or something fancy like a local-director.
//
// The default SourceForge domain
// this is used where ever the "naked" form of the SourceForge domain
// might be used.  E.g., "mailto:admin@sourceforge.net"
$sys_default_domain = "webdev.sourceforge.net";
 
// Machine that hosts CVS
$sys_cvs_host = "cvs.sourceforge.net";
 
// Machine used for downloading sources/packages
$sys_download_host = "download.sourceforge.net";
 
// Machine(s) that host users' shell accounts
//  N.B. to the SourceForge Crew: What's the difference between the user
// host and the shell host?  They are clearly two different hostnames
// in the source code, but they seem to serve the same purpose..?
$sys_shell_host = "shell.sourceforge.net";
$sys_users_host = "users.sourceforge.net";
 
// Machine that hosts docs (such as the FAQs and the various software
// licenses (*BSD, [L]GPL, etc.).  You REALLY want this to be the same
// machine that the SourceForge code is running on because all of the
// PHP makes reference to these documents in terms of relative paths that
// are part of the SourceForge code tree.
$sys_docs_host = "sfdocs.sourceforge.net";
 
// Machine that hosts the SourceForge mailing lists (This could also be
// the mail host if you have enough horsepower & bandwidth)
$sys_lists_host = "lists.sourceforge.net";
 
// Domain Name Servers
//    N.B.: Use terminated FQDNs here (with the final ".") so the resolver
//    doesn't attempt to recurse in the case of a slightly broken DNS
//    configuration
$sys_dns1_host = "ns1.sourceforge.net";
$sys_dns2_host = "ns2.sourceforge.net";

// Part II - Databases, html/php/other paths
$sys_dbhost="localhost";
$sys_dbname="alexandria";
$sys_dbuser="www";
$sys_dbpasswd="";
$sys_server="mysql";
 
// Where files are placed when uploaded
$FTPINCOMING_DIR = "/nfs/remission/u7/ftp/incoming";
$FTPPROJECT_DIR="/nfs/remission/u7/ftp/projects";
 
// Where the SourceForge files are placed
// *** IMPORTANT: sys_urlroot *MUST* be an ABSOLUTE FILEYSTEM PATH NAME
//             that points to the www directory of the SourceForge
//             installation.  If you use ANY form of relative path
//             you will break the html_image function in include/html.php
//
$sys_urlroot="/alexandria/www/";
 
// Cache location -- this is needed by include/cache.php
// This directory must be world reachable, but writable only by the web-server
$sf_cache_dir = "/sfcache";
// Name of the system as a whole (needed by various utils and titles)
$sys_name="prodigy";
 
 
// Part III - GUI modifications (menu colors, etc.)
//    See the top of the file include/html.php, this is where the menu colors
//    and colors used throughout SourceForge are defined.
 
// End of customizations -- place nothing after the closing PHP tag!
